# The method above does not work properly for me, I researched further and found this instead, it works for me but just make sure
# that you install the full pytorch package
# command below is for the gpu version (if you have an nvidia gpu then it works) 
# pip3 install torch==1.9.0+cu102 torchvision==0.10.0+cu102 torchaudio===0.9.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# if you don't then the command above will cause errors when you try to run code
# use this command instead: pip install torch torchvision
